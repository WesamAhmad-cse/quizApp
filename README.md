Simple Flutter application, is my first project in flutter and it contain a questions and multiple answers.

## Features

#### 
 1- Answer Selection:
 - The widget is designed to represent an answer  option in a quiz.
- It uses the InkWell widget to detect taps on the answer, and the onTap 


 2- Styling and Decoration:

 -The answer option is displayed as a DecoratedBox with rounded corners and a border.

- The background color changes based on whether the    answer is selected or not. If selected, it uses a green color; otherwise, it uses white.

- A border is added around the answer box to provide visual separation.

3- Icon and Text Display:

 - The answer option includes an icon and text.

 - An Icon widget is used to display an icon associated with the answer. The color of the icon changes based on whether the answer is selected.

- The answer text is displayed using a Text widget.

4- Dynamic Styling Based on Selection:
- The color of the background, icon, and text changes dynamically when an answer is selected. This provides visual feedback to the user about their selection.
